#                                      WHICH RECTANGLE IS BIGGER                                     #

#    In this Task, you need to compare the area of two rectangles and say which one is bigger                     #
#    First, user enter the width and height for the first rectangle.                                 #
#    Second, user enter the width and height for the second rectangle.                               #
#    Then you have to calculate the area for each rectangle.                                         #
#    Finally, compare their areas and print a proper message,                                              #
#    if the first one is bigger print "FIRST ONE IS BIGGER"                                          #
#    if the second one is bigger print "SECOND ONE IS BIGGER"                                        #
#    if they are equal print "SAME SIZE"                                                             #

# Step1: get the width of the first rectangle and store it as width1


# Step2: get the height of the first rectangle and store it as height1


# Step3: get the width of the second rectangle and store it as width2


# Step4: get the height of the second rectangle and store it as height2


# Step5 : calculate the area for first rectangle and store it as area1


# Step6 : calculate the area for second rectangle and store it as area2


# Step7 : Compare the area1 and area2 using an if statement and print proper message.
